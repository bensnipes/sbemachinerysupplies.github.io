                        <p>
                            There are few industrialists in history who could match Elon Musk's relentless drive and 
                            ingenious vision. Musk is the man behind Paypal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of 
                            which has sent shock waves throughout business and industry. In this lively, investigative 
                            account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the 
                            remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive
                            access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult
                            upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world.
                        <p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Since arriving in the United States in 1992, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave
                            disappointments alongside massive success. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a 
                            life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned
                            Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing 
                            his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars.

                            Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business 
                            history: Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth
                            soared to more than $5 billion.

                            This is a brilliant, penetrating examination of what Musk's career means for a technology
                            industry undergoing dramatic change and offers a taste fo what could be an incredible century
                            ahead.
                        </p>


                            <p>

                            Do you think I'm Insane?
                            This question came from Elon Musk near the end of a long dinner we shared at a high-end seafood
                            restaurant in Silicon Valley. I'd gotten to the restaurant first and settled down with a gin 
                            and tonic,knowing Musk would-as ever-be late. After about fifteen minutes, Musk showed up 
                            wearing  leather shoes, designer jeans, and a plaid dress shirt. Musk stands six foot one 
                            but ask anyone who knows him and they'll confirm that he seems much bigger than that. He's 
                            absurdly broad-shouldered, sturdy, and thick. You'd figure he would use this frame to his
                            advantage and perform an alpha-male strut when entering a room. Instead, he tends to be almost
                            sheepish. It's head tilted slightly down while walking, a quick handshake hello after reaching
                            the table, and then butt in seat. From there, Musk needs a few minutes before he warms up and 
                            looks at ease.</p>


                            <p>
                            Musk asked me to dinner for a negotiation of sorts. Eighteen months earlier, I'd informed him 
                            of my plans to write a book about him, and he'd informed me of his plans not to cooperate. His
                            rejection stung but thrust me into dogged reporter mode. If I had to do this book without him,
                            so be it. Plenty of people had left Musk's companies, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX, and would talk,
                            and I already knew a lot of his friends. The interviews followed one after another, month
                            after month, and two hundred or so people into the process, I heard from Musk once again. He 
                            called me at home and declared that things could go one of two ways: he could make my life
                            very difficult or he could help with the project after all. He'd be willing to cooperate if he
                            could read the book before it went to publication,and could add footnotes throughout it. He 
                            would not meddle with my text, but he wanted the chance to set the record straight in spots that
                            he deemed factually inaccurate. I understood where this was comming from.
